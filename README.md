## Dataset

The data sets we will use are the Covid-19 dataset and the datasets related to the population, economy, and food supply. We want to study the relationship between food and nutrition on COVID-19 susceptibility and lethality.

## Objective

The objective of the project is to research on the influence of demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests and medication factors on the sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score), which is usually applied to track a person’s organ function or rate of failure while staying at ICU. Some machine learning algorithms will be deployed to explore their relationships. The result will be beneficial for the ICU staff to reduce the physiological emergency happened on patients.

- **What is the data product(s) that will be generated? For example, the project can generate one or more of the following**

The project will end up with a report describing how we solve a specific health related problem following data science workflow, as well as the result of the problem. We also plan to illustrate our project results publicly by establishing a dashboard.

- **A sketch of the data science plan, which may include (if appropriate)**
    - Data plan (Extract, Load, Transform)
    
      - Week 6 (09/25 - 10/02): Gain access to the MIMIC dataset. Download dataset and data cleaning. Extract information for the project.  
      - Week 7 (10/02 - 10/09): Exploratory data analysis.  
      - Week 8 - 12 (10/09 - 11/05): Maintain database. Update database if more information is required.
    
    - ML plan (Model training, evaluation, selection, deployment, monitoring)
    
      - Week 6-7 (09/25 - 10/09): Literature review  
      - Week 8-9 (10/09 - 10/23): Model training, evaluation, fine-tuning and selection  
      - Week 10 and after: Deploy and monitor model performance

    - Technology stack (databases, python packages, cloud platform)
    
      - Week 8-9 (10/09 - 10/23): Identify, learn and import necessary python packages
