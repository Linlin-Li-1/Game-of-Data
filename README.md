## To do list

    - The specific data sets you will be working with
    - The objective of the project and how it benefits the target consumer
        - What is the data product(s) that will be generated? For example, the project can generate one or more of the following
            - Report (e.g. auto-generated PDF)
            - Dashboard
            - Online ML algorithm
            - App
            - Other
    - A sketch of the data science plan, which may include (if appropriate)
        - Data plan (Extract, Load, Transform)
        - ML plan (Model training, evaluation, selection, deployment, monitoring)
        - Operations plan (workflow orchestration, CI/CD, containerization, serverless, testing, packaging, logging)
        - Technology stack (databases, python packages, cloud platform)
    - Roles, responsibilities and *timed milestones* for each team member
        - Plan for *accountability* but be willing to help out team members
        - Ask team members for help if you are overwhelmed
    - Use [Piazza for cross-team experts on Sakai](https://sakai.duke.edu/x/NiVyZI)
