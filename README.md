## Dataset

The data sets we will use are the COVID-19 dataset and the datasets related to the population, economy, and food supply. We want to study the relationship between food and nutrition on COVID-19 susceptibility and lethality.

## Objective
In the past few months, we have witnessed doctors, nurses, and thousands of medical staff putting their lives on the front line to save infected patients. As the battle against COVID-19 continues, we should all ask ourselves what should we do to help? What can we do to protect our loved ones, those who sacrificed for us, and ourselves from this pandemic? One possible way to protect the health of our family and ourselves is to adapt to healthy eating habits.

The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) recommends a very simple daily dietary intake: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein, but do we really follow the recommendations of these food to eat a healthy diet? Do we need to adjust our eating habits based on the diet patterns of countries with a low COVID-19 infection rate?

In China, some doctors recommend that people eat more eggs and drink more milk to improve their immunity. We would like to use statistical analysis to study the relationship between eggs and other foods and the infection rate and fatality rate of COVID-19, and analyze whether these suggestions may be effective. The results will be beneficial to all people who suffer from this pandemic and hope to protect themselves.

- **What is the data product(s) that will be generated? For example, the project can generate one or more of the following**

The project will end up with a report describing how we identify and examined the relationship between food and nutrition and COVID-19 following data science workflow, as well as the result of the problem. We also plan to illustrate the visualization results publicly by establishing a dashboard.

- **A sketch of the data science plan, which may include (if appropriate)**
    - Data plan (Extract, Load, Transform)
    
      - Week 6 (09/25 - 10/02): Gain access to the MIMIC dataset. Download dataset and data cleaning. Extract information for the project.  
      - Week 7 (10/02 - 10/09): Exploratory data analysis.  
      - Week 8 - 12 (10/09 - 11/05): Maintain database. Update database if more information is required.
    
    - ML plan (Model training, evaluation, selection, deployment, monitoring)
    
      - Week 6-7 (09/25 - 10/09): Literature review  
      - Week 8-9 (10/09 - 10/23): Model training, evaluation, fine-tuning and selection  
      - Week 10 and after: Deploy and monitor model performance

    - Technology stack (databases, python packages, cloud platform)
    
      - Week 8-9 (10/09 - 10/23): Identify, learn and import necessary python packages
